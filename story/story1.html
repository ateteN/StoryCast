                        To Neil, saying that the moon landing is fake can be taken as a compliment for the advancements in science.

                <p>
                    In 1969, the world watched as humans first set foot on the Moon. 
                    For many, it remains one of the greatest scientific achievements 
                    in history. Yet, decades later, questions and skepticism still linger.
                    Did it really happen exactly as we were told?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this StoryCast audio feature, we explore the debate surrounding 
                    the Apollo 11 mission through the perspective of astrophysicist 
                    <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong>. Responding to claims that the 
                    Moon landing was staged, Tyson breaks down the science, logic, and 
                    evidence behind one of the most persistent conspiracy theories of 
                    modern times.

                            <strong>Interviewer:</strong> For everyone that says the 1970s Moon landing was fake,
                            that it was done in a Hollywood studio somewhere — what do you say to them?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> Well, I have several replies. One of them is,
                            isn’t it amazing that our technological and scientific achievements are so great
                            that members of the civilization that created it are in denial of it?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What a compliment to how far that technology has come.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> So NASA goes to Hollywood and says,
                            “We have to fake this Moon landing. What will it require?”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After considering the complexity — the launch, the environment, the physics —
                            they conclude that it would actually be simpler to film it on location.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> There were thousands of scientists and engineers
                            involved. You can calculate how much fuel was in the rocket — it was a 36-story tall
                            structure filled mostly with fuel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To fake something of that scale would require an effort so massive that
                            you might as well just do it for real.
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                    <dt><time datetime="PT3M06S">[03:06]</time></dt>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> One thing that all conspiracy theorists have in
                            common is that they already know the answer they want.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where they don’t have data to support it, they invoke a cover-up.
                            That allows them to fill gaps in their argument without evidence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> I once asked someone what evidence would convince
                            them that we landed on the Moon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I showed them satellite images of the landing sites, they dismissed it,
                            simply because they did not trust the source.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At that point, no evidence will ever be enough.
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                    <dt><time datetime="PT5M15S">[05:15]</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson:</strong> If evidence is rejected simply because it does not
                            match a belief, then the discussion can no longer move forward.
